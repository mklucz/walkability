<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What you're seeing here is a set of maps generated with <a href="https://github.com/mklucz/drogi">drogi</a>, a Python module I wrote. The maps are intended to visualize urban walkability and identify unwalkable areas.
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>In short: OpenStreetMap data about walkways is turned into a graph and walked, randomly and repeatedly, with an A* algorithm. The resulting paths and the areas causing paths to deviate from a straight line are then colored in.
You can read about the details <a href="https://github.com/mklucz/drogi/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</p>
